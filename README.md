# Computer-Vision-and-Deep-Learning-based-Wood-Log-Analysis-System-for-Timber-Industry


Automate wood log analysis using YOLOv8 and YOLOv5.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to automate the wood log analysis and minimise the human intervention.

## Output
The output that we'll be getting in a CSV file and image will be respectively based on the results. 

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:
- [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)

All required files are included in the repository.

## Usage

### Code Modifications
If not running in Google Colab, make the following modifications in the code:
- Adjust file paths as needed.

### Features
1. **Total Number of Logs**
2. **Log Diameter Analysis in pixels**
   - Set prices based on log diameter and converting the pixels according to desired .
3. **Crack Detection**
   - Identify logs with cracks.
4. **Wood Log Roundness Identification**
   - Categorize logs based on it roundness.
